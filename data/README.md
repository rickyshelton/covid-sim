# Data Directory and Samples

This directory provides sample input data and an example script to run.

**IMPORTANT**: The parameter files are provided as a sample only and do not
necessarily reflect runs used in published papers.

## Directories

- *populations*: provides population density information

- *admin_units*: specifies the administration units for each country

- *param_files*: Provides sample parameter files

## Running the sample

The file `./run_sample.py` will build and run a sample for a specified country.

### Usage

```sh
./run_sample.py <COUNTRY>
```

For example:

```sh
./run_sample.py United_Kingdom
```

This will:

1. Build a copy of the CovidSim executable configured for the appropriate
   country (in this case the UK)

2. Do a no intervention base run. This run also provides various `*.bin`
   files for the later run.

3. Do a run with controls applied. This is the step to be repeated when
   doing further tests/runs.

The sample script has more command line options available.  See
`./run_sample.py --help` for a list.
